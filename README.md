# SonidosApp
A short app testing the power and simple way of making apps with the Ionic Framework. The app consists of a list of animals that play a sound, can be arranged or eliminated. Refreshing the app will reset them. 

## Usage

Click or push any animal with the "play" button to play the animal's specific sound, slide to the left to erase an Animal. Pull the app down to "refresh" it and reset the list of animals.

## Further notes

* This is my first mobile app made with Ionic. 
* The simplistic way of dealing with the functions here made it an excellent approach compared to React Native.
